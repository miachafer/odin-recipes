    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are many tales about the origin of the Margarita cocktail. The most romantic one is that the cocktail was created by a man as a gift to his gilfriend, in the city of Puebla, <strong>Mexico</strong>. The man was Danny Negrete, a manager of a hotel. His girlfriend loved salty flavors, so he created the classic Maragarita with salt rim.</p>
    <p>The main ingredients are tequila, orange liqueur, and lime juice, but you can change the cocktail flavour by exchanging the lemon juice for other flavours, such as strawberry, pineapple, mango, etc.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Use a lime slice to wet the rim of the glass and dip it in salt.</li>
